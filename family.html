				<p>My family is really special to me. My parents, Dana and Andrew, are the best. They met freshman year of college at The University of Ohio State. I love to spend time with my mom, go shopping with her, and go on walks with her. I love to go to yoga with my dad, try new foods with him, and hang out. I have a younger brother, Grant, who is 18 years old. It is really funny because he has red hair, and no one else in my family does. He is going to Colgate University to [play lacrosse next year. One of my favorite things to do with him is bake and cook because he will try anything I make for him (most of the time). Lastly, is my dog Jordie. She is 7 years old and is a mini goldendoodle. She is the cutest dog ever and I love her so much. </p>
